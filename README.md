# ESP32-C3 Plant Watering Controller

A custom PCB for an ESP32-C3 based plant watering controller that features two channels to drive 12V water pumps and one input to check for low water level. If using esphome as [firmware](#firmware) it can be easily integrated into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

If you'd like to solder the PCB yourself, the smallest component to be soldered is 0603. The list of components and their placement is available as [interactive BOM](bom/ibom.html).

If you only need one channel (for a single pump), you can leave R5, R6, R11 D7, D9, Q2 and J3 unpopulated.

## External Parts

For a full-fledged plant watering solution you'll need some additional components/parts. Links go to AliExpress, but you can of course source the components from other sources if you prefer a different suppliers.

## Firmware

The firmware I am running on the controller is based on [esphome](https://esphome.io/). I am using the following snippet (for a single channel and a moisture sensor named `sensor.plant_herbs_balcony_soil_moisture`), which you'll probably want to customize to integrate with your Home Assistant instance and WiFi.

## Integration

The PCB does not offer a built-in mechanism to measure soil humidity, but the [b-parasite](https://github.com/rbaron/b-parasite) open source project provides a suitable DIY capacitive soil moisture sensor that can easily be integrated using ZigBee / Home Assistant.
